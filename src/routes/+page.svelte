        Bob, Jeremy, and the other 5 coworkers in the Bertram Labs office love coffee. In fact, everyday,
        right after lunch, they walk down the street to their favorite coffee shop to grab a cup to go. Bob
        always gets a cappuccino, Jeremy likes his coffee black, and the others have their favorite
        coffee beverage too. To ease the checkout process, only one coworker pays for all the coffees
        each day. As you can imagine, they have a problem everyday: who's turn is it to pay for coffee?
